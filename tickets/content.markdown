## At-the-door tickets

We hope to sell tickets at the door on the day of the event, but there is no guarantee! Purchasing online is the safest way to ensure your spot. We recommend buying tickets as soon as possible.

## Need-based free tickets

Brooklyn Gamery aims to make this event accessible by offering low-cost tickets. However, we also know some people have low/no income and therefore are unable to afford the ticket price. If this is the case for you, [please fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfV7aKnQGl4UTgF0HvA2x5WQQoO7kil4UjElp3QssLBLyLpeg/viewform) â€“ we will happily help you gain access to this event. This opportunity ends on June 15.
