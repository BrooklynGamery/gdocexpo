The expo is a community-run event. You make it possible! We need volunteers to help run the event and show games by developers of color outside New York City.

Volunteers will receive free admission and help to show games at our expo on June 24, 2017. People who volunteer for the full event will be compensated with a gift card, food, and beverages.
