## Submit your game

Are you a game developer of color? Want 600+ people to play your game during our arcade? [Submit your game using this form](https://goo.gl/forms/zO86dMEeCwuFwPLJ3)! We accept games by individual developers as well as multi-person teams. Those in and outside of New York City are encouraged to apply before March 15, 2017 – it's free.

Although we may not be able to offer travel assistance if your game is accepted (depends on the amount of sponsorship we receive), our team can help showcase your work remotely. There are no restrictions other than that at least one person of color must be making a substantial contribution to the game.

## Volunteer
We need volunteers to help show games by developers of color outside New York City. Volunteers will receive free admission and help to show games at our expo on June 24, 2017. People who volunteer for the full event will be compensated with a gift card, food, and beverages.

If you will be available to help set up and show a game, [fill out this application form](https://goo.gl/forms/MHDwKRAziFJM4TDv2). Application period closes on April 15, 2017.
