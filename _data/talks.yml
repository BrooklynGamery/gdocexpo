  time: 4:15PM - 5:00PM
  description: 'The discussion around games as culture is still fairly young when compared to other mediums. Often designers claim their games basically mean nothing, despite being heavy handed with metaphors while appropriating from numerous cultures all at once. Conversely, what if we took a step back and instead focused on working with our own culture, our beliefs, and our identities to give our work a distinct flavor that only we can? 
In this panel we will hear from several developers who will talk about what this means to them, and how this approach can be used to make games better.
