  description:  As a daughter of a mostly rural Indian family, my clothing choices were monitored very strictly. Growing up, dress up games gave me an outlet where I could dress as I wanted without reprimand. '(try to) Dress Up' is a game than functions like the dress up games I loved but with a twist. It reflects my real world experience with dressing up- you'll have to get my parents' permission before going out in what you're wearing. Good luck with that... they're pretty tough judges.
