## GDoCE 2017
The 2017 Game Devs of Color Expo took place on June 24, 2017 in New York City. In this day-long event at the historic Schomburg Center, we held panels and talks, with an expo hall filled with unique games made by creators of color. Talks ranged from calls to action for creating games, discussions about the culture around games, the game development process, and experiences within the games industry as people from different backgrounds. 

Some quick facts about GDoCE 2017:
* 472 Attendees
* 31 Games Shown [2017 Games Archive](/archive/2017/games)
* 25 Speakers and Panelists [2017 Schedule Archive](/archive/2017/schedule)

We’ve received some incredible feedback from attendees and press, and we’re working on an even better 2018 event.
