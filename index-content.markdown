The fifth annual Game Devs of Color Expo will be fully online for 2020.

At the virtual Game Devs of Color Expo, new and experienced game developers will share, learn, and connect in unique ways. This year’s event will feature main presentations within a private online conference space that supports conversations between attendees. We will also host exclusive developer interviews through our Steam showcase, Gradient Convergence. **You’ll be able to support creators of color by playing their games in the comfort of your home!**

Speakers at this year's event will cover a wide variety of topics including game art, compelling game design, marketing, and sound design. Games at this year’s expo include *ValiDate: Struggling Singles in your Area* by Veritable Joy, *Lucifer Within Us* by Kitfox Games, *An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs* from Strange Scaffold, and *Onsen Master* by Waking Oni Games.

Giving developers of color the space to speak about anything but their own marginalization shouldn’t be a grand gesture, but in the gaming industry it feels like an exemplary move
