# We’re back for 2021!

<img src="/assets/images/photos/2021/2020GDoCExpo1.jpg">

Last year at the 2020 online Game Devs of Color Expo, we had over 1,500 people show up - two times as many people as our in-person 2019 event. We gave away $90k in game development grants, too. 

The good news is we’re set to hold our 2021 event from September 23rd through the 27th and we’ll be online again!

Game and speaker submissions are now closed. Stay tuned for our expo selections announcement!
