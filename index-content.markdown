# We’re back for 2021!

<img src="/assets/images/photos/2021/2020GDoCExpo1.jpg">

Last year at the 2020 online Game Devs of Color Expo, we had over 1,500 people show up - two times as many people as our in-person 2019 event. We gave away $90k in game development grants, too. 

The good news is we’re set to hold our 2021 event from September 23rd through the 27th and we’ll be online again!

Game submissions from game developers of color are now open. We’d love to feature your game! It’s free to submit and showcase, and you’ll have a bunch of eyes on your game. We are also seeking people to interview for the expo and for grant recipients.

Speaker spots are also now open, too. All of our speakers are paid. If you’re selected to speak, your presentation will also be released on our YouTube after the event for more exposure.
