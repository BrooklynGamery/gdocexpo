Game Devs of Color Expo returned to the Schomburg Center in Harlem, New York on July 27, 2019! 

The 4th annual Game Devs of Color Expo was an inclusive games expo and conference creating a new normal in games by putting creators of color at the forefront, showing off their games, building conversations, and pushing games forward as an artform. [#GDoCExpo](https://twitter.com/GDoCExpo)

In the expo hall, we played <strong>20+ titles</strong> including the super stylish <strong>HyperDot</strong> which was just featured as part of the Xbox Experience at E3, <strong>Sashimi Slammers</strong>, a fish fighting game where the controller is literally a fish (can't make this stuff up,) and <strong>Can Androids Pray</strong>, a shortform narrative game about angry femme mechs at the end of the world.
