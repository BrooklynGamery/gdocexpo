Get ready: the Game Devs of Color Expo is going virtual on September 19, 2020! Since 2016, people from around the world have united in Harlem, NYC to collectively elevate the games industry. This year, things will be a little different—for the safety and health of our community, we will gather online.

At the virtual Game Devs of Color Expo, new and experienced game developers will share, learn, and connect in unique ways that wouldn’t have been possible in-person. <b>Stay tuned to hear when tickets go live</b>—follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gdocexpo), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GDoCExpo/), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gdocexpo/) for updates.

Giving developers of color the space to speak about anything but their own marginalization shouldn’t be a grand gesture, but in the gaming industry it feels like an exemplary move
