## Where the money goes

Brooklyn Gamery wants to make this event the best it can be. Since we're a 3-person studio, we can't do that alone. You can help us to make the 2017 Game Devs of Color Expo a quality event worthy of attendees' time.

Sponsorship and donations help us pay for the following:

- Tickets for attendees in need
- The larger venue in Manhattan
- Meals and snacks for attendees
- Equipment for showing games
- Compensation for volunteers
- Compensation for speakers and workshop teachers
- Travel assistance for developers
- Collateral, badges, lanyards, and signage
- Photography, videography, and livestreaming
- Assistance for people with different (and awesome!) abilities
