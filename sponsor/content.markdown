# Sponsor the event

## Why sponsor gdocexpo?

This is an opportunity for you and your company to help level the playing field.

#### Our audience is unique and diverse

We receive submissions from around the globe. Our attendees come from all across the United States. You have the opportunity to align with and learn from the future of our globalizing world.

#### Our audience has potential

The gaming population mirrors the world population, but the game development industry does not. You have the chance to support and uplift new voices that are creating interesting and powerful work but do not have the same access to assistance from peers and mentors.

#### Our audience needs investment

More people of color make games every year thanks to tools like Game Maker, Unreal, and Unity. However, some are unable to attend larger gaming conferences due to the prohibitive cost of ticket prices and travel. Over 400 people attended last year's event, and we expect 700 to attend this year (in addition to more via livestreaming).

#### Our audience is creating change

People of color are now more powerful and necessary in games than ever. The industry is only improved by those who are willing to push it forward, and the games shown at this event are not only high quality but also new and different.
