## What is the Game Devs of Color Expo?
The GDoC Expo is a games expo and conference pushing to create a new normal in games; putting creators of color at the forefront, showing off their games, creating conversations, and overall pushing games forward as an artform.

Giving developers of color the space to speak about anything but their own marginalization shouldn’t be a grand gesture, but in the gaming industry it feels like an exemplary move
