The Game Devs of Color Expo is a safe space where you can express yourself in a respectful manner without fear of judgment or harassment. All participants and visitors are expected to treat other participants, visitors, staff, and the general public with respect. Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants to be mindful of their speech and behaviors, whether in person or online. Participants and visitors should refrain from making assumptions about anotherâ€™s identity, experience, and preferred pronouns.

No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to physical harassment, verbal harassment, threats of violence, and any form of sexual assault. We do not condone the use of harmful racial, ethnic, sexual, or gender-based slurs of any kind. Participants asked to stop unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. Those who violate this policy will either be removed from the event with no refund and/or reported to the authorities.

No weapons will be allowed at our event, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

While screenshots are permitted, no broadcasts or recordings of presentations are allowed without confirmation from GDoCExpo staff.
