The Game Devs of Color Expo is a safe space where you can express yourself without fear of judgment or harassment. All participants and visitors are expected to treat other participants, visitors, staff, and the general public with respect. Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and on social media. Particularly, we want to remind participants and visitors to refrain from making assumptions about another's identity, experience, and preferred pronouns.

No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated, this includes but is not limited to physical harassment, verbal harassment, and any form of sexual assault. Those who violate this policy will either be directed to leave the premises or reported to the authorities.

If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please talk with an organizer or volunteer. You can also [report a violation using this form](https://goo.gl/forms/T9SgQmkhkHQz0J7U2) if you feel more comfortable contacting us digitally. If you see someone being treated with disrespect, please speak up either yourself or by getting an organizer/volunteer involved. With your help we can make sure everyone involved is being treated with respect.
